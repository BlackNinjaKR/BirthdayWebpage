# 🎂 Happy Birthday Julia! 🎈

_An interactive birthday webpage crafted with love, code, and lots of confetti. 🎉🎉_

## ✨ What is this?

This is not just another project folder—it’s a virtual celebration built for my amazing, long-distance friend, **THE MANLIEST MAN ALIVE**.  
It's filled with music, memories, hugs, sparkles, and yes, an embarrassing amount of floating emojis.

You can't cut cake through the screen (yet), but this is my version of showing up anyway—pixels, code, heart, and all.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **HTML/CSS/JS** – the usual suspects
- [Swiper.js](https://swiperjs.com/) – for the smooth memory lane scrolling
- [Canvas Confetti](https://github.com/catdad/canvas-confetti) – because static birthdays are boring
- **Particles.js** – to add that dreamy vibe to the background
- Audio via native `<audio>` and some browser-wrangling
